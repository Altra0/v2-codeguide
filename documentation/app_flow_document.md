# LOCO Career Alignment & Onboarding System - App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

Upon arriving at the LOCO platform, new users are welcomed by a modern and clean landing page that clearly presents the value of the AI-powered career alignment and onboarding system. Users have the option of creating an account using their email and a password or signing up with a trusted OAuth provider via Clerk Auth. After entering basic personal details such as full name, email, and date of birth, the system sends a verification email if needed. Once verified, the AI career companion, CiCi, greets the user with a welcoming message that outlines the journey ahead. For users who forget their password, a simple “Forgot Password” option is provided, which guides them through a secure password recovery process. Depending on the type of user – whether a secondary school student, sixth form candidate, undergraduate, recent graduate, job seeker, career professional, parent, or employer – the onboarding flow customizes the questions to capture academic status, work experience, skills, interests, and ultimate career aspirations. In the case of minors, additional steps ensure parental consent and present a clear privacy notice. Once the initial registration and role-specific data are submitted, the process transitions into a guided career assessment led by CiCi.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After the user has completed the onboarding process, they are taken to the main career dashboard. This dashboard serves as the central hub for managing every component of the career alignment journey. Upon logging in, users see a clear header with the LOCO logo styled in bold caps and a navigation menu that offers access to key areas such as the personalized roadmap, skills overview, job market insights, and SEDO project recommendations. Widgets on the dashboard display progress bars, upcoming milestones, and recent AI-powered recommendations that update automatically with real-time job market data. The layout is designed to be intuitive, with card-based sections that invite users to interact with elements like bookmarking favored career paths, manually refining skill maps, or checking for notifications from CiCi. Navigation is seamless as each clickable element transitions the user to the next phase – whether they want to dig deeper into academic milestones or shift focus to professional career goals.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The user’s journey begins with a guided self-assessment where they input relevant academic or professional data. In this initial career assessment phase, CiCi leads users through questions that capture interests, current skills, experiences, and long-term aspirations. Users are then presented with a list of recommended career pathways, generated by AI algorithms using structured data and real-time market insights from Weaviate and OpenAI. Each suggested career option includes detailed role descriptions, industry demand information, and key skills required, and users can take steps to bookmark one or more options for further exploration. Moving on from the assessment, the system seamlessly transitions to the roadmap generation step. Here, users view a visually engaging page that outlines short-term, intermediate, and long-term goals visualized in timelines that differ based on user segments – academic milestones for students and job milestones for professionals. Users can manually adjust these recommendations if they prefer to tweak the roadmap. From the roadmap page, users can access detailed modules for each core feature. For example, via the Skills & Experience Mapping page, users are allowed to modify, add, or remove skills as the system predicts the ideal skill set. Similarly, the Industry & Experience Selection page lets them choose up to three industries and adjust entries to include work experience, projects, and extracurricular activities. If users require more detailed comparison against ideal candidate profiles, they can access a dedicated comparison tool page, where side-by-side visualizations show the current profile versus the ideal profile. In addition, the SEDO Projects Integration is managed through a specifically designed internal SEDO API. A dedicated page displays project listings categorized by difficulty levels (from beginner to trailblazer) and is connected with automatic matching based on the user’s skill gaps. Users can manually filter project recommendations, ensuring a blend of automated suggestions and personalized choices. The transitions amongst these pages are smooth, aided by dynamic routing and automatic updates that keep the interface current with the latest data, while also allowing users to revisit any section at will.

## Settings and Account Management

Within the platform, users have access to a robust settings section that manages personal information, preferences, and privacy options. Users can update their email, password, and profile information such as location and preferred language (noting that the platform is currently UK focused). Specific sections are provided for role-based data details – for instance, students can update academic information, while career professionals can update work experience and desired career shifts. The privacy dashboard is an integral part of the settings, allowing both minors and their parents to control data sharing, adjust visibility settings, and review parental consent details. If a user subscribes to additional career support services or SEDO projects, there is a billing and subscription management section as well. After making any changes, a clear navigation option allows users to return directly to their main dashboard without losing context, ensuring that account management is kept separate but easily accessible from anywhere in the platform.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Throughout the entire journey, error states and alternate flows are clearly handled to ensure a smooth user experience. For example, if a user enters invalid data during sign-up or the career assessment, they are immediately given a clear error message outlining what went wrong and offered a way to correct it. Connectivity issues trigger fallback screens that explain the temporary lack of service, automatically prompting the user to try again as the system refreshes its data feeds. If a user attempts to access a feature that they are not authorized for – such as a minor trying to join advanced SEDO projects without parental consent – a detailed error page appears with instructions and links to the Privacy Dashboard for further guidance. In all instances, error messages are designed with simple language and enable users to quickly return to a normal flow by suggesting corrective actions or providing a direct link back to their dashboard.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the moment a user first accesses the LOCO platform, they are guided through an intuitive and engaging process that starts with account creation and role-specific onboarding. CiCi, the AI-powered career companion, introduces each user to a custom-tailored experience that progressively builds from basic career assessments to sophisticated roadmap generation. Whether the user is a student, professional, parent, or employer, every step – from entering personal and academic data to manually refining AI recommendations – is connected and smooth. The personalized dashboard serves not only as a central hub for tracking progress but also as a dynamic interface that automatically integrates real-time market insights and evolving career recommendations. The journey is designed to help users achieve their career goals while maintaining robust settings for account personalization, strict data privacy, and secure role-based access. The LOCO system ensures that users are always supported by clear error handling and seamless page transitions, culminating in an overall experience that is as engaging as it is informative.
