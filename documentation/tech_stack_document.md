# Tech Stack Document

This document explains the underlying technologies chosen for the LOCO Career Alignment & Onboarding System. It is written in simple language so anyone can understand why each component was picked to create a fast, secure, and engaging experience for all users.

## 1. Frontend Technologies

We use modern tools to build a clean and responsive interface. Here’s what we chose and why:

*   **Next.js**

    *   A React-based framework that helps build fast and scalable websites.
    *   It makes our pages load quickly and is great for both desktop and mobile experiences.

*   **Tailwind CSS**

    *   A styling tool that provides ready-to-use classes to craft a flexible and modern design.
    *   It allows designers to quickly change layouts and appearances without writing lengthy CSS code.

*   **ShadCN UI Components**

    *   Pre-built, interactive UI elements that fit in well with modern design principles.
    *   These components make it easier to create smooth and consistent interactions on the site.

*   **Typescript**

    *   A superset of JavaScript that adds type-checking, which reduces errors and makes it easier to maintain and scale the code over time.

## 2. Backend Technologies

Behind the scenes, the application needs to work quickly and reliably while managing lots of user data and smart recommendations. The backbone includes:

*   **Node.js (Express.js)**

    *   A lightweight and efficient server framework that handles API requests and business logic.
    *   It makes it possible to manage many users at once and responds quickly to user actions.

*   **Supabase**

    *   Provides real-time subscriptions and a PostgreSQL database for storing structured user data.
    *   This ensures that every piece of data, from academic records to career goals, is stored safely and is easy to retrieve.

*   **Weaviate**

    *   A vector search database that powers AI-driven recommendations.
    *   It helps match user profiles with career paths by comparing skills and interests using advanced semantic search techniques.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment

For a smooth and reliable service, careful choices were made in setting up our infrastructure:

*   **Hosting & Deployment:**

    *   We deploy our web application using proven platforms (for example, Vercel is part of our toolkit), ensuring fast global delivery and scalability.

*   **CI/CD Pipelines:**

    *   Automated deployment pipelines are set up so that updates can be rolled out quickly and reliably with every code change.

*   **Version Control Systems:**

    *   Git and GitHub are used for managing our codebase, promoting collaboration and ensuring that every change is tracked.

*   **Starter Kit:**

    *   We use the CodeGuide Starter Pro kit, which comes with a predefined project structure. This speeds up development and ensures best practices out of the box.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

The system integrates several third-party services to enhance its functionality:

*   **Clerk Auth:**

    *   Handles secure user authentication and role-based access, making sure that only approved users get to see and modify data.

*   **OpenAI API:**

    *   Powers CiCi’s conversational and recommendation capabilities. It helps provide personalized guidance based on user inputs.

*   **Weaviate:**

    *   In addition to serving as our vector search database, Weaviate is essential for matching career pathways and SEDO projects to user profiles using artificial intelligence.

*   **Additional Tools:**

    *   **Cursor, V0 by Vercel, and Claude 3.7/3.5 Sonnet:** These advanced tools offer real-time coding suggestions and assist in building efficient components, ensuring our development process stays modern and responsive.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations

Our system is designed with strong security and smooth performance in mind:

*   **Secure Authentication & Role-Based Access:**

    *   By using Clerk Auth, we ensure that data is only accessible to users with the appropriate permissions. This is crucial for handling sensitive profiles, especially when minors are involved.

*   **Data Encryption & Privacy:**

    *   All personal data is protected through end-to-end encryption (HTTPS in transit and encrypted storage). This complies with regulations like GDPR and COPPA.

*   **Performance Optimizations:**

    *   Real-time updates and automatic refresh mechanisms keep the interface current with minimal delay. Optimized query handling in Supabase and Weaviate ensures a smooth user experience even during peak usage.

*   **Scalability:**

    *   The chosen technologies allow us to scale the system as the number of users grows, ensuring that performance remains robust over time.

## 6. Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

The LOCO Career Alignment & Onboarding System uses a thoughtful combination of modern technologies. Here’s a quick recap:

*   **Frontend:** With Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, and Typescript, we build an attractive and responsive interface that makes the user journey intuitive and engaging.
*   **Backend & Data:** Node.js with Express.js, Supabase’s real-time database, and Weaviate’s vector search create a robust foundation to handle data and smart, AI-powered recommendations.
*   **Infrastructure:** Our deployment via trusted host platforms, automated CI/CD pipelines, and structured project management ensure reliability and ease of future updates.
*   **Third-Party Services:** Integrations such as Clerk Auth and OpenAI API boost security and personalization, while tools like Cursor and Vercel support a cutting-edge development process.
*   **Security & Performance:** Emphasis on encryption, role-based controls, and real-time updates keep our system both secure and efficient, meeting regulatory standards and user expectations.

In essence, every technology in our stack has been chosen to deliver a personalized, dynamic, and secure career guidance experience. This careful selection not only meets the project goals but also lays a strong foundation for future growth and integration possibilities.

This robust tech stack is designed to keep users engaged and informed throughout their journey while addressing the unique needs of diverse user segments—from students and professionals to parents and employers.
